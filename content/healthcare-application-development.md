      subHeading: Why you need
      text: |       

      lists:
      - Access Healthcare Anytime, Anywhere! With an app, your patients can get access to care no matter where they are, thus decreasing health risks caused due to unattended emergencies or lack of resources in remote areas.
      - In the longer run, an application will prove to be more economical for your business as it will enable you to eliminate extra costs for you as well as your patients. Since many tasks like booking appointments, getting results, etc. will be taken over by apps, your labor needs will reduce.
      - Enhanced, Transparent and Easy payment processes. An application will be able to store your patient’s payment information making recurring purchases like prescriptions a piece of cake for them and for you. Moreover this reduces your vulnerability to fraudulent activities and risks of counterfeit currencies.
      - Positive Impact on Patient Outcomes. With an application, you get access to a lot of your patient’s information which helps in attaining a more accurate outcome, a better treatment plan, and consequently improved patient outcomes. All of which will eventually convert into a better reputation, more credibility and profit for your organization.
