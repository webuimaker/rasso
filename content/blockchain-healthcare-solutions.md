          Comprehensive EHRs for Patients & Providers
        text: |
         Blockchain solves the menace of scattered health records distributed between the patient and doctor in such a way that none of them has access to complete health records.    

         By maintaining patient data on Blockchain, both the professional and the patient can access a shared platform containing all the records, resulting in better communication, more accurate diagnosis, and consequently a better suited treatment plan.
