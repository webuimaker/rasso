          Contract Staffing
        text: |
          Why waste assets on hiring full-time when you can staff employees for a short time whenever you need?    

          Raisso delivers the most efficient, and logistical contract staffing services wherein a business can absorb the required resources from us when their needs escalate and simply discontinue when the pace slows down.    

          All you need to do is settle an hourly wage for the candidate along with an estimated tenure, and leave the rest to us! We’ll deal with all the HR duties pertaining to payroll, insurance, and distribution as soon as the contract starts.

         Raisso supplements your business with ideal, skillful and experienced candidates everytime without fail. Even when it comes to the most eligible candidates happily employed and not looking to switch, we can draw them towards you!    

         With permanent placement services, companies can onboard our consultants and avail their stellar services.    

         All you need to do is cross the T’s and dot the I’s on a common agreement entailing the discussed fee and a guarantee provision that serves us both well.

          Contract to Hire
        text: |
          With our Contract to hire services, you can adequately assess the candidates before actually committing full term employment to them.    

          This spares you the regret of unfit hiring and you can observe whether a candidate with potential will be beneficial to your company in the longer run.    

          Similar to contract hires, we discuss an hourly wage along with an estimated tenure for the candidate. The difference however, is that after the said period, the candidate is provided regular employment with the company, should you deem fit.    

          As for Raisso, we’ll take a nominal fee once the candidate is converted into an employee.
